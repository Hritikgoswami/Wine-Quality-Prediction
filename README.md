## Introduction

Step into the enchanting world of predicting wine quality ‚Äì a challenge that has enthralled both oenophiles and data sorcerers. In this venture, we harness the prowess of data analysis and predictive modeling to decipher the enigma behind wine quality assessment. Join us in uncovering the correlations that influence the subjective perception of wine excellence.

[This project](https://github.com/Hritikgoswami/Wine-Quality-Prediction) is a case study for modelling taste preferences based on the [analytical dataset](https://github.com/Hritikgoswami/Wine-Quality-Prediction/blob/main/Wine-Quality-Dataset.csv) that we have from physiochemical tests of wines.

## Vintage Dataset

Our canvas is painted with data from [analytical dataset](https://github.com/Hritikgoswami/Wine-Quality-Prediction/blob/main/Wine-Quality-Dataset.csv), housing a splendid collection of red and white wines. Each bottle is an artwork, characterized by a symphony of attributes ranging from acidity and residual sugar to alcohol content. These attributes lay the foundation for the qualitative journey, as wines are rated on a scale from 1 to 10.

Input variables:  

- **fixed acidity:** No. of grams of tartaric acid per dm3
- **volatile acidity:**  No. of grams of acetic acid per dm3 of wine
- **citric acid:** No. of grams of citric acid per dm3 of wine
- **residual sugar:** Remaining sugar after fermentation stops
- **chlorides:** No. of grams of sodium chloride per dm3 of wine
- **free sulphur dioxide:** No. of grams of free sulphites per dm3 of wine
- **total sulphur dioxide:** No. of grams of total sulphite (free sulphite+ bound)
- **density:** Density in gram per cm3 
- **pH:** To measure ripeness 
- **sulphates:** No. of grams of potassium sulphate per dm3 of wine
- **alcohol:** Volume of alcohol in %
- **quality (target):** 1-10 value


Classification criteria:

The scores for quality(x) are set between 0-10 as follows:  
**Bad:** 0<=x<=4   
**Medium:** 5,6  
**Good:** 7<=x<=10 

## Embarking the Journey

As you step onto this voyage of discovery, here's your compass:

1. üåê Clone this repository onto your machine.

   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hritikgoswami/Wine-Quality-Prediction.git
```

2. üß© Install the spells we'll need - just cast.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## The Alchemy - Model

For making automated decisions on model selection we need to quantify the performance of our model and give it a score. Therefore, accuracy rate of the model is checked on each prediction. Here, [Random Forest](https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest#:~:text=Random%20forest%20is%20a%20commonly,both%20classification%20and%20regression%20problems.) has the maximum accuracy rate.

Behold the cauldron that shapes the future! Our [Random Forest](https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest#:~:text=Random%20forest%20is%20a%20commonly,both%20classification%20and%20regression%20problems.) is the ancient recipe we employ to predict the essence of wine quality. Crafted and honed through the ages, it is brought to life through the essence drawn from the dataset.
